# Bible Jeopardy

### Overview
A simple game board for a Bible Jeopardy game. Includes categories with each category containing five questions. The questions have varying degrees of difficulty, just like the normal Jeopardy game. There are many categories so multiple rounds can be played without reusing questions. The app contains a game board view as well as a game manager. By using a split screen, the players and audience can see the game board while the person running the game can see the answers to questions and control the game.
